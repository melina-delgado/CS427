I discussed my solution with: no one

I had the hardest time figuring out how to read from stdin.
Then I realized that C++ is less tricky than C and found it easier.
Then, I stored values into doubles, and had issues with retaining floating
point values. I also forgot to convert from degrees to radians for the final
calculation. My calculations are still off from the sample, but I believe this is
because of how I handled negative inputs.
