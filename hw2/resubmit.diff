Melina Delgado hw2 resubmission:
In mainSpinout.cpp, my while condition was slightly incorrect, not 
printing "illegal move" for moves of indices < 0 or > 7.
For spinout.cpp, Professor Glenn and I found a bug in office hours on 12/18 where
my isLegalMove function had an incorrect if statement. I fixed it in the diff below.

<       while((cin >> index)&&(!(cin.eof()))&&((index < 7)&&(index>0)))

>       while(cin >> index && !cin.eof())
