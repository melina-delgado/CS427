     I discussed my solution with no other student.

     I had major difficulties understanding how the copy constructor worked
     and the assignment operator. Also had a to learn how to read in files
     in C++. Also, understanding the Conway game was difficult at first,
     but once I understood it I feel like I became better at implementing the
     game. I ended up passing all the test cases in the end.
