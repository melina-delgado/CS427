     Did not discuss solution.

     The major difficulty I encountered was learning how to properly inherit in C++. 
     I understood that basic concepts but learning how multiple files interact with each other and 
     dealing with compiling errors took the bulk of my time. I also did a lot of research on virtual
     functions.
