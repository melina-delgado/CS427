     I asked Addie Elwood a number of questions, but this was after the deadline.

     The major difficulties I encountered was mostly the math and logic behind
     the game Fission. The largest problem I had with the assignment was being
     unable to find the game online so that I could play it and understand it.
     Once I just started going thorugh test cases, they guided me in the right
     direction.
