     I discussed my solution with Addie Elwood. I really only asked her questions
     with errors I was having. She had already finished the problem set and it was less
     collaborative/sharing and more of her just helping me out.

     Most of the difficulty I had with the problem set was understanding it. Then, I think
     my understanding of inheritance was a little shaky and I had to read up on some of how
     inheriting variables and initializing them in the base class worked. Then I read up on 
     smart pointers because I was unfamiliar with them and I wanted to learn. All in all, I
     liked this problem set because it challenged my understanding of how inheritance works.
